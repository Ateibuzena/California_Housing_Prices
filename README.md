- [Multiple Linear Regression](regresion_lineal_multiple.ipynb): Learn how to implement multiple linear regression and explore its advantages!

## 📊 Conclusions

### Multiple Linear Regression

#### 🎯 Model Accuracy:
- My model has a good level of accuracy, with an \( R^2 \) of 0.737, indicating that approximately 73.7% of the variability in the number of "households" can be explained by the predictor variables I've used.

#### ❌ Errors:
- The MAE and RMSE values indicate a margin of error in the predictions. Although the RMSE is considerably higher than the MAE, suggesting some larger errors in the predictions.

#### 📊 Comparison with Simple Models:
- The RAE and RSE show that my model is significantly better than a trivial model (such as always predicting the mean), which is a positive sign.

#### 💡 Model Efficiency:
- The adjusted \( R^2 \) is very close to the \( R^2 \), suggesting that the predictors I've chosen are adding value to the model and there is no overfitting.

### Simple Linear Regression

#### 🎯 Model Accuracy:
- My model has a moderate level of accuracy, with an \( R^2 \) of 0.399, suggesting that approximately 39.9% of the variability in "median_income" can be explained by "median_house_value".

#### ❌ Errors:
- The MAE and RMSE values indicate significant errors in the predictions. The RMSE is considerably higher than the MAE, suggesting the presence of large errors in the predictions.

#### 📊 Comparison with Simple Models:
- The RAE and RSE indicate that my model is only somewhat better than a trivial model, suggesting that the relationship between "median_house_value" and "median_income" may not be very strong or that important variables are missing in my model.
